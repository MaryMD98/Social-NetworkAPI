## [Description](#description)

In this homework, I created an API for a social web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends's thoughts, and create a friend list. I used mogoose models to sync to the MongoDB database. For this homework, we do not have a front end, so I used insomnia to test the routes to create users and thoughts. Some of the routes I created are the update, delete and get one user. add or delete friends from each user friend list. Create, delete and update thoughts, create and delete reactions and get all thoughts or all users.
